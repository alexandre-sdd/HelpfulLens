\section{Refined EDA: Exposure vs. Helpfulness}
\label{sec:eda_refined}

This section summarizes the refined exploratory analysis built from cleaned parquets (7M reviews). Figures come from \texttt{reports/eda\_refined/figures} (generated via \texttt{scripts/eda\_refined.py}).

\paragraph{Skew and zero inflation.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_distribution.png}{0.6}{Heavy skew in helpful votes; most reviews have zero, a small tail exceeds 1{,}000.}{eda_helpful_dist}

\paragraph{Popularity vs. helpfulness.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_vs_cool.png}{0.48}{Helpful vs.\ cool votes (sample).}{eda_helpful_cool}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_vs_funny.png}{0.48}{Helpful vs.\ funny votes (sample).}{eda_helpful_funny}
Helpful correlates with cool/funny (shared exposure), so these are exposure controls, not targets.

\paragraph{Author reputation.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_by_user_fans.png}{0.6}{Mean helpful by user fan bins.}{eda_helpful_fans}
High-fan authors attract more helpful votes; fan count is a key confounder for visibility.

\paragraph{Content length.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_by_length_decile.png}{0.6}{Mean helpful by review length decile.}{eda_length}
Longer reviews earn more helpful votes (monotonic trend), but length alone is not sufficient.

\paragraph{Place and category.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_by_category.png}{0.48}{Mean helpful by business category (top 20).}{eda_category}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_by_city.png}{0.48}{Mean helpful by city (top 15).}{eda_city}
Certain cuisines and locales drive higher helpfulness, reflecting audience/density effects.

\paragraph{Temporal patterns.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_by_month.png}{0.48}{Mean helpful by month.}{eda_month}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/helpful_by_weekday.png}{0.48}{Mean helpful by weekday.}{eda_weekday}
Seasonality/weekday effects are mild; included as controls.

\paragraph{Correlations.}
\includefig{../reports/eda_refined/figures/correlation_heatmap.png}{0.6}{Spearman correlation among numeric features.}{eda_corr}
Length correlates moderately with helpful; star ratings are weak; no single feature dominates, supporting multi-signal models (length + reputation + context).

\paragraph{Reproducibility.}
Regenerate figures with:
\begin{verbatim}
python scripts/eda_refined.py \
  --review-path data/cleaned/reviews_clean.parquet \
  --business-path data/cleaned/business_clean.parquet \
  --user-path data/cleaned/users_clean.parquet \
  --out-dir reports/eda_refined
\end{verbatim}
